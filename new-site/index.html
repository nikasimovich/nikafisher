      <span>I&rsquo;m a graphic designer, writer, and educator based in New York.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="start">
      <span>Currently, I&rsquo;m an Assistant Professor of Communication Design at Parsons School of Design.</span>

    <span>I really enjoy communicating via email. It&rsquo;s slow, intentional, and unexpected. <a href="">Will you send me one?</a></span>
  </div>

  <div class="start">
    <span>Design and writing are very similar. At the end of the day it&rsquo;s all about how you make something interesting. Often, that means being as specific as possible.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="start">
    <span>My written work explores how design changes over time, and highlights underreported voices in internet and design history.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="start">
    <span>The ways that design becomes more of a philosophy and framework are fascinating to document, especially when it becomes less of a profession and more of a way to experience the day-to-day.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="start">
    <span>Writing offers a way to connect with history and design more intimately.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="start">
    <span>I&rsquo;m curious about the materiality of the internet. How does it look at its core and how does it permeate into everyday life?</span>

    <span>Belgrade, January 2013. A kiosk selling &ldquo;old world&rdquo; folklore: rakija shot glasses, tiny wooden spoons, miniature war caps with Србија woven on the front, cannisters embellished with the Serbian flag. A pair of mannequins were on display, too. They wore Angry Bird caps, crochetted in a traditional style.</span>

  <div class="start">
    <span><a href="https://www.labud.nyc/">Labud</a> is a design studio I co-founded in 2018. Labud means &ldquo;swan&rdquo; in Serbian, which is my mother tongue, though you probably wouldn&rsquo;t guess that from speaking with me. I&rsquo;m fully bi-lingual but I&rsquo;m more articulate in English.</span>

  <div class="start">
    <span>Two things coincided with my birth: the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the birth of the world wide web.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="start">
    <span>I grew up between Los Angeles, St. Louis, and The Bay Area. I spent one year in Santa Cruz but have spent my entire adult life in New York City. I have lived longer in New York City than anywhere else.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="start">
    <span>I spent one year living in Santa Cruz, CA. Supposedly, the apartment I lived in was designed for nudists in the 1970s though this claim was never corroborated.</span>
