        <h2>Routines</h2>
        <h3>Morning Routine</h3>
        <p>Oberon will sleep until you do. As soon as you wake up, take him on a quick stroll around the block allowing him to &ldquo;do his business.&rdquo; Upon your return, feed Oberon breakfast.</p>
        <h3>Walks</h3>
        <p>Oberon goes on 4 walks a day (in the morning, at midday, after dinner, before bed).</p>

        After breakfast, Oberon will likely want to play while you work. You can toss a toy down the hall for him a few times and then continue on with your work. During this time, Oberon will usually play with his stuffed white puppy and take a nap. Around 12pm, Oberon will want to go on a walk again. If the weather permits, this can be a longer walk — take Oberon to Astoria Park. If it is too hot or too cold, do a shorter walk and do a longer one later. Around 5pm, Oberon might stare at you and bark firmly — this usually means he&rsquo;s ready to eat. Feed him dinner, and then take him on a walk. The final walk can be a quick one around 9 or 10pm before he goes to bed.</p>
        <p>To take Oberon on a walk, ask him, &ldquo;Do you want to go on a walk?&rdquo; Then, take his colorful harness and place it on the floor, he will give you one paw after the other to be strapped in. During the colder months, put Oberon in one of his sweaters or outerwear before putting the harness on.</p>

        <h3>Leaving Oberon at Home</h3>
        <p>If you need to leave Oberon at home, place him, his white stuffed puppy, and his water bowl into the main bedroom. Close the bathroom door in that room. If it is hot, make sure the blinds are drawn and the air conditioning is turned on. Once you&rsquo;re ready to leave, you can say, &ldquo;Okay Oberon, you&rsquo;re going to stay home.&rdquo; Close the bedroom door before you leave. We do not like to leave him alone very often, but he is capable of holding down the fort for several hours (up to nine at most).</p>

        <h3>Bed Time</h3>
        <p>Oberon usually goes to bed before we do. He will usually retreat to the bedroom with his stuffed white puppy. Most of the time, he sleeps in the dog bed underneath our bed. He is permitted to sleep on the main bed, too.</p>

        <h2>Food and Treats</h2>
        <h3>Meals</h3>
        <p>Oberon eats 2x a day  — once in the morning, once in the evening. He eats the Turkey recipe from Farmer&rsquo;s Dog. Serve him one fourth of the package at breakfast and at dinner. On most days, Oberon has breakfast around 9am and dinner between 5 and 6pm. Replace his water bowl at both serving times.</p>
        <h3>Snacks</h3>
        <p>Oberon always receives a treat when we come home from a walk. He will usually go to his place (dog bed in the living room) and wait patiently for one. If he doesn&rsquo;t go to his place on his own, say &ldquo;Oberon, do you want a treat? Go to your place!&rdquo; and he should go there. Once he does, give him a single treat from the orange bags above the coffee maker. Provide other treats at your own discretion.</p>
        <h3>Scraps</h3>
        <p>Oberon receives a lot of scraps. Have him wait patiently until you&rsquo;re done eating, and then feel free to share your food with him. Oberon especially loves cheese, carrots, and broccoli. Do <strong>not</strong> feed Oberon: onions, grapes, chocolate, as those are poisonous to dogs.</p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>
          <h3>Commands</h3>
          <p>Oberon understands the following commands: &ldquo;sit,&rdquo; &ldquo;sit pretty,&rdquo; &ldquo;twirl,&rdquo; &ldquo;pirouette,&rdquo; &ldquo;speak,&rdquo; &ldquo;quiet,&rdquo; &ldquo;touch,&rdquo; &ldquo;place,&rdquo; &ldquo;paw,&rdquo; and &ldquo;high five.&rdquo; He might not want to do them if he isn&rsquo;t in the right headspace, but you can tempt him with treats.</p>

          <h3>Clicker</h3>
          <p>Oberon was trained with a clicker, a small blue device that makes a clicking noise (this is how dolphins are trained, too!). If you are having trouble getting Oberon&rsquo;s attention, press the clicker once, then give him an easy command, like &ldquo;sit&rdquo;. If he sits, press the clicker again, audibly reward Oberon (&ldquo;Good job!&rdquo;) and give him a treat. Try redirecting his attention by asking him to &ldquo;touch,&rdquo; (place your hand in front of him), or to make a business agreement (offer your hand for a handshake and say &ldquo;paw.&rdquo;) </p>

          <h3>Naughty Behavior</h3>
          <p>Sometimes Oberon likes to bark. To curb this behavior, try using the method described in the &ldquo;Clicker&rdquo; section. If that doesn&rsquo;s work, place Oberon in the bedroom with his puppy for a time out. If Oberon is being sassy, say &ldquo;ah ah Oberon, we don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

          <h3>Quirky Behavior</h3>
          <p>Oberon is very attached to his cream colored stuffed puppy. Sometimes he will hump it, and then fall asleep with it. If he is nervous, make sure he has the puppy with him, as he finds it soothing.</p>
          <p>Sometimes Oberon sounds like he is choking — he is not. This is called a reverse sneeze. If you are on a walk, pause for a moment and let him calm down. At home, let him sneeze and he will settle down.</p>
          <p>Oberon is a highly sensitive individual. Sometimes changes scare him. If on the first day he is staying with you, he does not want to eat, or throws up after eating, it&rsquo;s probably OK as long as he resumes his normal schedule the following day.</p>
