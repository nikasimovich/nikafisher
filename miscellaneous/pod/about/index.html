        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Writers often beat creative block by starting with a sentence.
          For design, it can be hard to begin.
          I developed this exploration as a way of sketching during downtime.
          Exercising a small level of curation, I used a found <a href="https://nonsense.x2d.org/" target="_blank">nonsense generator</a> to provide a sentence, which became the content for a somewhat regular poster series. While the sentences are mysterious, they read poetic and often times relatable.
          It&rsquo;s interesting to see how your imagination fills in the gaps.</p>
